#
# Handy set of docker commands to build/run
#
# Steps (refer to movie)
#   1) Install Docker  - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
    2) Maven Install:  Project=> Run As => Maven Install  (this creates target dir with jar file from the project)
#   3) git bash (or other term) in root project dir (with the Dockerfile)
#   4) build and run the instance with port mapping to host from docker instance
#   5) use stop/start to control existing container
#   6) use ps to get docker ID (for use in start/stop)
#   7) if you "run" again, you make a new instance (waste RAM/CPU/Disk...)
#   8) (your running app) = (base docker image) + (your app.jar) ... on any platform
#
# general docker commands
docker --version
docker ps -a   # list all running/not running containers

# docker build/run command tags name per this project
docker build -t spring02_webmvc .
docker run -dp 8081:8081 spring02_webmvc   

# docker start/stop (you'll need to use ps to get Docker ID
docker container stop xxxxxxxxxx  # get ID from ps command
docker container start xxxxxxxxxx

#  DO NOT REPEAT THE RUN!!  Unless you delete ...you will be making multiple instances!
